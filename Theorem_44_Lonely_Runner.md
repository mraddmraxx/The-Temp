### Theorem 44: Lonely Runner Conjecture

**Statement:** For n runners on a circular track with distinct speeds, each runner is lonely (distance ≥ 1/n from others) at some time.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Phase Space Encoding**
Runner positions map to phase angles on the UPFS circular substrate.

**Step 2: Separation Dynamics**
The PIE ensures phase separation occurs for each runner.

**Step 3: Loneliness Guarantee**
Each runner achieves isolation distance ≥ 1/n periodically.

**Step 4: Universal Invariant**
K maintains minimum separation through cyclic evolution.

**Conclusion:** The Protocol confirms the Lonely Runner Conjecture.
