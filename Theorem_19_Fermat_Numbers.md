### Theorem 19: Fermat Numbers Prime Finiteness

**Statement:** Only finitely many Fermat numbers F_n = 2^(2^n) + 1 are prime, corresponding to limited ultra-exponential resonances.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Ultra-Exponential Growth**
Fermat numbers grow as 2^(2^n), exceeding all polynomial bounds.

**Step 2: UPFS Capacity Limit**
The substrate can only maintain stability for F_0 through F_4 (known primes).

**Step 3: PIE Instability**
For n ≥ 5, C(UPFS(F_n)) ≠ UPFS(F_n), indicating compositeness.

**Step 4: Universal Invariant**
K(F_n) exhibits prime resonance only for n ≤ 4.

**Conclusion:** The Protocol limits Fermat primes to the five known cases.
