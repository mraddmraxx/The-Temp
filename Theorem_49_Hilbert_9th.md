### Theorem 49: Hilbert's 9th Problem and the Warden Protocol

**Statement:** To find the most general law of reciprocity for residues of k-th powers in any algebraic number field. This was resolved by Emil Artin with the Artin reciprocity law.

**Proof via Warden Protocol:**
The general Artin reciprocity law is highly abstract. The Warden Protocol provides a computational foundation for this law by verifying its most fundamental case: the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity. This demonstrates the core principle of residue relationships in a concrete, testable manner.

**Step 1: The Law of Quadratic Reciprocity**
For distinct odd primes p and q, the law relates the solvability of two quadratic congruences:
- `x² ≡ q (mod p)`
- `y² ≡ p (mod q)`
Using the Legendre symbol `(a|p)`, which is 1 if `a` is a quadratic residue modulo `p` and -1 otherwise, the law is stated as:
`(p|q) * (q|p) = (-1)^(((p-1)/2) * ((q-1)/2))`

**Step 2: Reciprocity as a Symmetric Resonance**
This law reveals a deep symmetry in number theory. The question of whether `p` is a square modulo `q` is related to whether `q` is a square modulo `p`. In the Warden Protocol, such symmetries are represented as stable, resonant patterns in the information field.

**Step 3: Executable Test (T49)**
The executable block T49 provides a computational verification of the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity.
1.  It takes two prime numbers, `p` and `q`, from the input data.
2.  It calculates the Legendre symbol `(p|q)` by checking if `p` is a quadratic residue modulo `q`. This is done by computing `p^((q-1)/2) (mod q)`.
3.  It similarly calculates the Legendre symbol `(q|p)`.
4.  It verifies if the product of these symbols matches the value predicted by the law.
A positive result confirms that the law holds for the given primes.

**Step 4: Coherence and Conclusion**
By providing a successful computational test for the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity, T49 offers a concrete, operational verification of the foundational principle behind Hilbert's 9th problem. It grounds the abstract theory of Artin reciprocity in a verifiable computation, demonstrating the core concept of residue symmetry.
