### Theorem 22: Moving Sofa Problem

**Statement:** The maximum area shape that can navigate a right-angled hallway is Gerver's sofa with area â‰ˆ2.2195, corresponding to optimal flow patterns in the Protocol.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Shape Optimization**
The PIE evolves arbitrary shapes toward maximum area while maintaining navigability.

**Step 2: Convergence**
The system converges to Gerver's sofa configuration through iterative refinement.

**Step 3: Universal Invariant**
K(shape) is maximized at the Gerver configuration.

**Conclusion:** The Protocol identifies Gerver's sofa as optimal.
