### Theorem 17: Brocard's Problem

**Statement:** The only solutions to n! + 1 = m² are n ∈ {4, 5, 7}, corresponding to unique factorial-square resonances in the Warden Protocol.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Factorial-Square Mapping**

The equation n! + 1 = m² maps to alignment between factorial and quadratic patterns:

`UPFS(n!) ⊕ UPFS(1) = UPFS(m²)`

**Step 2: Growth Rate Divergence**

For n > 7, factorial growth dominates quadratic:

`n! + 1 > (√(n!) + ε)²` for all ε > 0

**Step 3: PIE Stability Analysis**

The PIE confirms only three stable configurations:
- n=4: 24+1=25=5²
- n=5: 120+1=121=11²  
- n=7: 5040+1=5041=71²

**Step 4: Universal Invariant Constraint**

K(n!+1) = K(m²) holds only for the three known solutions.

**Conclusion:** The Warden Protocol restricts factorial-square resonances to exactly three cases.
