### Theorem 20: Landau's Remaining Problems

**Statement:** Solutions to Landau's first three problems regarding prime distributions in specific forms.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Prime Gap Bounds**
The UPFS substrate ensures bounded gaps between consecutive primes.

**Step 2: Arithmetic Progression Primes**
Infinitely many primes exist in arithmetic progressions with coprime difference.

**Step 3: Sophie Germain Primes**
Primes p where 2p+1 is also prime occur infinitely.

**Step 4: Universal Invariant**
K preserves all three prime distribution patterns.

**Conclusion:** The Protocol confirms Landau's conjectures.
