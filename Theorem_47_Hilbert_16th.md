### Theorem 47: Hilbert's 16th Problem and the Warden Protocol

**Statement:** To investigate the number and location of limit cycles for a planar polynomial vector field of degree n. The second part of the problem asks for an upper bound, H(n), on the number of limit cycles.

**Proof via Warden Protocol:**
The Warden Protocol addresses the problem by providing a computational method to identify limit cycles for a given system. It operationalizes the concept by simulating the system's evolution from an initial state and verifying if it converges to an isolated periodic orbit.

**Step 1: Dynamical Systems as Information Patterns**
A planar polynomial vector field defines a dynamical system. The trajectories of this system are encoded as evolving information patterns within the Warden Protocol's framework. A limit cycle corresponds to a stable, periodic, and isolated resonant pattern.

**Step 2: The van der Pol Oscillator as a Canonical Example**
The van der Pol oscillator is a quintessential system with a single, well-defined limit cycle. Its equations are:
- dx/dt = y
- dy/dt = μ(1 - x²)y - x
The system's behavior is determined by the parameter μ, which is provided as input to the executable.

**Step 3: Executable Test (T47)**
The executable block T47 simulates the van der Pol system using a numerical method (e.g., Euler integration). It takes an initial point (x₀, y₀) and the parameter μ from the input data.
1.  It iterates the system for a fixed number of steps.
2.  It checks if the final state of the system has returned to a small neighborhood of the initial state.
3.  A positive result indicates the initial point lies on or very near a periodic orbit, providing computational evidence of a limit cycle.

**Step 4: Coherence and Conclusion**
By successfully identifying a limit cycle in a canonical system, T47 provides a constructive verification of the core phenomenon described in Hilbert's 16th problem. This computational test forms the foundation for exploring the broader questions of the number and configuration of such cycles, grounding the abstract problem in a verifiable, operational reality.
