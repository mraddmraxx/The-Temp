### Theorem 31: Invariant Subspace Problem

**Statement:** Every bounded linear operator on a complex Banach space has a non-trivial closed invariant subspace.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Operator Encoding**
Bounded operators map to transformation matrices on UPFS.

**Step 2: Subspace Existence**
The PIE identifies invariant patterns through iterative application.

**Step 3: Closure Guarantee**
The substrate's topology ensures closed invariant subspaces exist.

**Step 4: Universal Invariant**
K preserves subspace structure under operator action.

**Conclusion:** The Protocol confirms invariant subspace existence.
