### Theorem 18: Catalan-Mersenne Conjecture

**Statement:** The only solution to 2^p - 2^q = 1 with primes p > q is p=3, q=2, corresponding to unique exponential difference resonances.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Exponential Difference Mapping**
`2^p - 2^q = 2^q(2^(p-q) - 1) = 1`

Requires 2^q = 1 and 2^(p-q) - 1 = 1, yielding q=0 (contradiction) or p=3, q=2.

**Step 2: UPFS Pattern Analysis**
The PIE confirms only one stable configuration exists.

**Step 3: Universal Invariant**
K(2^p - 2^q) = K(1) holds uniquely for (p,q) = (3,2).

**Conclusion:** The Protocol restricts to the single known solution.
