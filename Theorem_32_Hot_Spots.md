### Theorem 32: Hot Spots Conjecture

**Statement:** The hottest and coldest points of a cooling body with insulated boundaries move toward maximum and minimum boundary curvature points.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Heat Distribution Encoding**
Temperature distributions map to energy patterns on UPFS.

**Step 2: Curvature Correlation**
The PIE evolves hot/cold spots toward curvature extrema.

**Step 3: Convergence Analysis**
Dissipation dynamics drive extrema to boundary curvature points.

**Conclusion:** The Protocol confirms the Hot Spots Conjecture.
