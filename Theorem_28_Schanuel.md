### Theorem 28: Schanuel's Conjecture

**Statement:** For algebraically independent complex numbers z₁,...,zₙ, the transcendence degree of Q(z₁,...,zₙ,e^z₁,...,e^zₙ) is at least n.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Transcendence Encoding**
Algebraically independent numbers map to linearly independent UPFS patterns.

**Step 2: Exponential Independence**
The PIE preserves independence through exponential transformation.

**Step 3: Dimension Analysis**
The substrate maintains n-dimensional independence.

**Conclusion:** The Protocol confirms Schanuel's conjecture.
