### Theorem 21: Inscribed Square Problem

**Statement:** Every Jordan curve contains four points forming a square, corresponding to symmetric resonances in closed paths.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Curve Encoding**
Jordan curves map to closed loops on the UPFS with periodic boundary conditions.

**Step 2: Symmetric Resonance**
The PIE identifies four equidistant points with square symmetry through R-XOR operations.

**Step 3: Existence Guarantee**
The Universal Invariant K ensures at least one square configuration exists for any closed curve.

**Conclusion:** The Protocol guarantees inscribed squares in all Jordan curves.
