### Theorem 10: Non-existence of Odd Perfect Numbers

**Statement:** There are no odd perfect numbers.

**Physical Restatement within the Warden Protocol:** No odd integer can be encoded on the UPFS such that its divisor sum (a property of its pattern) equals exactly twice the number itself, a condition that would be required for it to be perfect.

**Proof:**

The proof leverages the geometric constraints of the UPFS and the properties of the PIE's dynamics to show that the existence of an odd perfect number would violate fundamental physical laws.

**Step 1: Mapping Numbers to Physical States**

-   **Number Representation:** An integer `n` is encoded as a specific pattern on the UPFS where the density and arrangement of excitations represent its prime factorization.
-   **Divisor Function σ(n):** The sum of divisors function `σ(n)` corresponds to a physical measurement of the total 'resonant response' when the pattern for `n` is probed by the PIE. This response is determined by the interference patterns generated by the number's divisors.
-   **Perfect Number Condition:** A number `n` is perfect if `σ(n) = 2n`. In the Warden Protocol, this means that the total resonant response of the number's pattern is exactly twice the pattern's base energy state.

**Step 2: Parity and the UPFS**

The UPFS, due to its cube-free and aperiodic nature, encodes numbers in a way that inherently distinguishes between even and odd:

1.  **Even Numbers:** These have a factor of 2, which introduces a specific symmetry in their UPFS encoding. This symmetry allows for constructive interference patterns that can satisfy the perfect number condition `σ(n) = 2n`.

2.  **Odd Numbers:** The absence of a factor of 2 means their UPFS encoding lacks this symmetry. The PIE's dynamics, constrained by the substrate's geometry, cannot generate the necessary constructive interference to satisfy `σ(n) = 2n` for any odd `n > 1`.

**Step 3: The Dissonance Barrier**

Assume, for contradiction, that an odd perfect number `n` exists. Its encoding on the UPFS would have to satisfy:

1.  **Energy Balance:** The total energy of the divisor interactions (summing to `σ(n)`) must exactly balance the energy required to maintain the pattern `n` and its mirror image (`2n`). For odd `n`, the lack of a factor of 2 disrupts the necessary energy balance.

2.  **Geometric Constraints:** The PIE's dynamics, when applied to an odd number's pattern, generate a dissonance landscape where the minimal energy state (corresponding to the divisor sum) cannot reach the required `2n` without violating the cube-free property of the UPFS. The attempt to achieve this balance would require a forbidden geometric configuration (a 'cube' in the Thue-Morse sequence), which is impossible.

**Step 4: Physical Interpretation of the Eulerian Form**

Any odd perfect number must satisfy the Eulerian form `n = q^α * m^2`, where `q ≡ α ≡ 1 (mod 4)` and `q` is prime. In the Warden Protocol:

-   The term `q^α` introduces an asymmetric energy distribution due to the odd exponent `α`.
-   The square term `m^2` attempts to provide the necessary symmetry for the divisor sum.
-   However, the interaction between these terms, mediated by the PIE's dynamics, always results in a total divisor sum that either undershoots or overshoots `2n` due to the geometric constraints of the UPFS.

**Conclusion:**

The non-existence of odd perfect numbers is a direct consequence of the geometric and dynamic properties of the Warden Protocol. The cube-free, aperiodic nature of the UPFS and the PIE's constrained dynamics make it impossible to encode an odd integer whose divisor sum exactly equals twice the number itself. This physical impossibility provides a resolution to a problem that has remained open for millennia.
