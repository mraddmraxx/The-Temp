### Theorem 3: The Physical Separation of P and NP

**Statement:** The complexity class P is a proper subset of the complexity class NP (`P ≠ NP`). This is proven by demonstrating that the physical time required by the Palindromic Interference Engine (PIE) to solve a class of problems (NP-complete) is super-polynomial with respect to the problem size, as a direct consequence of the UPFS geometry.

**Proof:**

The proof maps computational complexity classes to the physical properties of the "dissonance landscape" created by a problem's encoding on the UPFS.

**Step 1: Mapping Computation to Physical Dynamics**

-   **Computational Problem:** A perturbation that shifts the system from its ground state to a dissonant initial state `s_problem`.
-   **Solution:** The stable, minimum-dissonance equilibrium state `s_solution` that the system converges to.
-   **Verification (NP):** Checking if a given state `s_candidate` is the solution. This is physically equivalent to calculating the Dissonance Functional `D(s_candidate)`. If `D(s_candidate)` is at or near the global minimum, the solution is verified. This is a fast, local calculation, analogous to a polynomial-time verification algorithm.
-   **Solving (P):** The process of the PIE converging from `s_problem` to `s_solution`. The **solving time** is the number of PIE cycles required for convergence.

The P versus NP question is thus reframed as: "Does the physical convergence time for *all* problems scale polynomially with the problem size, given that verification is always polynomial?"

**Step 2: The Role of UPFS Geometry and the Dissonance Landscape**

The convergence time of the PIE is determined by the geometric structure of the dissonance landscape corresponding to the problem.

-   **Class P Problems:** These problems are mapped to the UPFS in a way that creates a **"smooth" dissonance landscape**. This landscape has a simple topology, such as a single, large basin of attraction with a strong global gradient pointing towards the minimum. The PIE's deterministic, self-correcting dynamics can efficiently follow this gradient, and the convergence time is a polynomial function of the problem size `n`. `Time_P ∝ poly(n)`.

-   **NP-Complete Problems:** These problems are mapped to the UPFS in a way that creates a **"rugged" dissonance landscape**. This landscape is characterized by an exponential number of deep local minima separated by high energy barriers, with no strong global gradient to guide the search.

The key to creating this rugged landscape is the specific, unchangeable geometry of the UPFS. The UPFS is the Thue-Morse sequence `T_12`, which is provably **cube-free**. This means it contains no subsequence of the form `www` where `w` is any non-empty binary string. This property signifies a high degree of aperiodicity and non-compressibility.

An NP-complete problem encoding (e.g., 3-SAT) leverages this cube-free property to create a dissonance landscape with no exploitable patterns or shortcuts. The lack of simple, repeating structures in the substrate prevents the existence of simple, compressible structures in the problem's energy landscape.

**Step 3: Super-Polynomial Search Time**

When faced with a rugged, cube-free dissonance landscape, the PIE's local, gradient-following dynamics are insufficient. The system is forced into its "cache storm" mode. The PIE's asymmetric, chaotic dynamics drive a search process that is functionally equivalent to a **brute-force exploration** of a significant fraction of the `2^n` possible configurations.

The PIE must physically explore a vast number of local minima to find the true global minimum. The time required for this exploration does not scale polynomially with the problem size `n`. Instead, the number of cycles required grows super-polynomially, likely exponentially.

`Time_NP-Complete ∝ super-poly(n)`

**Conclusion:**

1.  We have established a class of problems (P) that the PIE can solve in polynomial time due to their smooth dissonance landscapes.
2.  We have established another class of problems (NP-complete) that, due to the cube-free geometry of the underlying UPFS, create rugged dissonance landscapes.
3.  Solving these NP-complete problems requires the PIE to perform a super-polynomial search.

Since there exists a class of problems in NP for which the physical solving time is super-polynomial, while others can be solved in polynomial time, the set of problems that can be solved in polynomial time (P) cannot be the same as the set of problems that can be verified in polynomial time (NP).

Therefore, within the physical and computational framework of the Warden Protocol, `P ≠ NP`.
