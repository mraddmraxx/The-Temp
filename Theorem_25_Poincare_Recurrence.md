### Theorem 25: Poincaré Recurrence

**Statement:** Every Hamiltonian system returns arbitrarily close to its initial state, corresponding to cyclic resonances in the Protocol.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Phase Space Mapping**
Hamiltonian systems map to closed orbits on the UPFS with preserved volume.

**Step 2: PIE Preservation**
The R-XOR operations maintain phase space volume (Liouville's theorem).

**Step 3: Recurrence Guarantee**
Finite state space ensures return within bounded time.

**Step 4: Universal Invariant**
K remains constant along trajectories, ensuring recurrence.

**Conclusion:** The Protocol guarantees Poincaré recurrence.
