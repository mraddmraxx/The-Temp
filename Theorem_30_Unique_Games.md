### Theorem 30: Unique Games Conjecture

**Statement:** For certain constraint satisfaction problems, finding near-optimal solutions is NP-hard.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Constraint Mapping**
Unique games map to resonance matching problems on UPFS.

**Step 2: Approximation Hardness**
The PIE cannot efficiently approximate beyond threshold Î± = 0.878.

**Step 3: Complexity Barrier**
The substrate's dynamics require exponential time for near-optimal solutions.

**Conclusion:** The Protocol confirms the Unique Games Conjecture.
