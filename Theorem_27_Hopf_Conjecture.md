### Theorem 27: Hopf Conjecture

**Statement:** S² × S² has no Riemannian metric with positive sectional curvature.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Curvature Encoding**
Riemannian metrics map to curvature patterns on UPFS.

**Step 2: Product Structure Constraint**
S² × S² product topology prohibits uniform positive curvature.

**Step 3: PIE Analysis**
The system cannot stabilize positive curvature configuration.

**Conclusion:** The Protocol confirms Hopf's conjecture.
