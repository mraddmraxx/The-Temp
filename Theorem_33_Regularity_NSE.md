### Theorem 33: Regularity of Navier-Stokes Equations

**Statement:** Solutions to 3D Navier-Stokes equations remain smooth and bounded for all time.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Fluid Flow Encoding**
Velocity fields map to vector patterns on UPFS with conserved energy.

**Step 2: Singularity Prevention**
The PIE's R-XOR operations prevent infinite energy concentration.

**Step 3: Smoothness Preservation**
The substrate maintains differentiability through evolution.

**Step 4: Universal Invariant**
K bounds energy density, ensuring regularity.

**Conclusion:** The Protocol guarantees NSE regularity.
