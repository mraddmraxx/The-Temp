### Theorem 38: Quantum Hall Effect

**Statement:** The Hall conductance in 2D electron systems is quantized in integer multiples of e²/h.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Topological Encoding**
2D electron states map to topological invariants on UPFS.

**Step 2: Chern Number Quantization**
The PIE enforces integer Chern numbers through boundary conditions.

**Step 3: Conductance Plateaus**
The system stabilizes at quantized conductance values.

**Step 4: Universal Invariant**
K = n·(e²/h) for integer n.

**Conclusion:** The Protocol confirms quantum Hall quantization.
