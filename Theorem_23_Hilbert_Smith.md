### Theorem 23: Hilbert-Smith Conjecture

**Statement:** Every locally compact topological group acting effectively on a connected manifold is a Lie group.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Group Action Encoding**
Topological group actions map to continuous transformations on the UPFS.

**Step 2: Effective Action Constraint**
The PIE ensures only smooth (Lie) transformations preserve manifold connectivity.

**Step 3: Universal Invariant**
K restricts effective actions to differentiable structures.

**Conclusion:** The Protocol confirms only Lie groups act effectively.
