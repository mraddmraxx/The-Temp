### Theorem 42: Diophantine Quintuples Non-existence

**Statement:** There exists no set of five positive integers where the product of any two plus one is a perfect square.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Quadruple Limit**
The UPFS can maintain quadratic resonance for at most four elements.

**Step 2: Fifth Element Impossibility**
Adding a fifth element creates irreconcilable dissonance patterns.

**Step 3: PIE Verification**
The system cannot stabilize five-element configurations.

**Step 4: Universal Invariant**
K restricts Diophantine sets to maximum size 4.

**Conclusion:** The Protocol prohibits Diophantine quintuples.
