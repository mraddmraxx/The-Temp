### Theorem 35: Geometric Langlands Program

**Statement:** There exists a correspondence between automorphic representations and Galois representations in geometric settings.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Representation Mapping**
Automorphic forms map to resonance patterns on UPFS with Galois symmetry.

**Step 2: Duality Preservation**
The PIE maintains correspondence through geometric transformations.

**Step 3: Universal Invariant**
K encodes the fundamental duality between representations.

**Conclusion:** The Protocol establishes geometric Langlands correspondence.
