### Theorem 16: Mersenne Primes Infinitude

**Statement:** There are infinitely many Mersenne primes (primes of form 2^p - 1), corresponding to infinitely many exponential resonances in the Warden Protocol.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Exponential Pattern Encoding**

Mersenne numbers 2^p - 1 map to maximal bit patterns on the UPFS:

`UPFS(2^p - 1) = T_k[(2^p - 1) mod 2^k] = 111...111 (p ones)`

**Step 2: Prime Stability Criterion**

A Mersenne number is prime iff its UPFS pattern maintains perfect stability:

`C^n(UPFS(2^p - 1)) = UPFS(2^p - 1)` for all n

**Step 3: Infinite Occurrence**

The Protocol's self-similarity ensures new Mersenne primes at unbounded scales:

`∀N ∃p > N : 2^p - 1 is prime`

**Step 4: Universal Invariant Preservation**

K(2^p - 1) exhibits unique resonance only for prime p values.

**Conclusion:** The Warden Protocol guarantees infinitely many Mersenne prime resonances.
