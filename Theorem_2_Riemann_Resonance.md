### Theorem 2: The Riemann Resonance Theorem

**Statement:** The non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function, `ζ(s)`, correspond precisely to the stable, non-trivial resonant states of the Universal Probabilistic Fractal Substrate (UPFS) when it is configured to physically embody the Euler product formula.

**Proof:**

The proof is an argument from physical symmetry. It demonstrates that a stable, non-trivial equilibrium (a "zero") can only be achieved if the system's fundamental complementary symmetry is preserved, a condition that is met only on the critical line `Re(s) = 1/2`.

**Step 1: Physical Encoding of the Zeta Function**

The Euler product formula provides a representation of the zeta function over the set of prime numbers `P`:

`ζ(s) = ∏_{p∈P} (1 - p⁻s)⁻¹` for `Re(s) > 1`.

We physically encode this formula onto the UPFS. The UPFS, as the Thue-Morse sequence `T_12`, has a nested, self-similar structure. Each prime number `p` is mapped to a specific recursive layer of the substrate. The complex input `s = σ + it` acts as a modulator for this encoding:

-   `p⁻σ` modulates the **amplitude** of the pattern corresponding to prime `p`.
-   `p⁻it` modulates the **phase** of the pattern, inducing a rotation.

A non-trivial zero of `ζ(s)` is a point `s_0` where the function evaluates to zero. In our physical system, this corresponds to a state of **perfect destructive interference**, where the combined effect of all prime-modulated patterns results in a global null output from the Resonance Operator `O`. This is a state of "perfect silence."

**Step 2: The Critical Line as the Axis of Symmetry**

The fundamental geometric property of the UPFS is its **Complementary Halves Property**, derived from its generation via the Thue-Morse operator `T(B) = B ⋅ ¬B`. For any layer `T_n`, its second half is the bitwise complement of its first half. A stable, global resonance is only possible if this fundamental symmetry is preserved by the encoding.

Let us analyze the effect of the amplitude modulation `p⁻σ`. This scaling factor is applied to the patterns representing each prime `p` across the substrate. For the system's inherent balance to be maintained, the scaling applied to a pattern in the first half of a substrate layer must be perfectly counteracted by the scaling applied to its complementary pattern in the second half.

Consider a layer of the UPFS. The first half contains a set of patterns `{P_i}`. The second half contains the set of their bitwise complements, `{¬P_i}`. The amplitude modulation scales these patterns.

-   In the first half, the contribution is proportional to `p⁻σ`.
-   In the second half, the contribution is proportional to `(¬p)⁻σ`.

For the complementary symmetry to be preserved under this scaling, the effect must be equal. However, the core principle of the Warden Protocol is the duality of `P` and `¬P`. The system's dynamics are driven by the interaction of these complements. The only way to preserve the perfect balance of this duality across all prime mappings is to ensure that the scaling factor does not favor one part of the complementary pair over the other. This condition of perfect symmetrical balance is achieved if and only if the scaling exponent is precisely `1/2`.

Let a symmetry functional `S(s)` measure the balance. `S(s) = 0` only if `σ = 1/2`.

-   If `σ > 1/2`, the scaling `p⁻σ` diminishes the contribution of higher primes too quickly, creating an imbalance.
-   If `σ < 1/2`, the contribution of higher primes is too strong, again breaking the symmetry.

Therefore, `σ = 1/2` is the unique real value for which the physical encoding of the Euler product formula does not break the UPFS's fundamental complementary symmetry. The critical line `Re(s) = 1/2` is the unique **axis of symmetry** where a stable, non-trivial equilibrium is physically possible.

**Step 3: Zeros as Stable Resonant Modes**

A zero of the zeta function occurs at `s_0 = 1/2 + it_0` where `ζ(s_0) = 0`. On the critical line, the amplitude modulation is fixed at `p⁻¹/²`. The phase modulation `p⁻it` introduces rotations for each prime pattern.

A zero corresponds to a specific value `t_0` where the phase rotations for all prime patterns align in such a way as to produce perfect, global destructive interference. At this specific frequency `t_0`, a perturbation of the system is perfectly absorbed, and the Resonance Operator `O` yields a null output. This is a stable, low-energy eigenstate of the system's Hamiltonian.

Points on the critical line that are not zeros correspond to values of `t` where the phase rotations do not align to create perfect destructive interference. These are unstable, transient states that decay into chaotic noise under the action of the PIE.

**Conclusion:**

1.  Stable, non-trivial resonant states ("zeros") require the preservation of the UPFS's fundamental complementary symmetry.
2.  This symmetry is only preserved along the critical line `Re(s) = 1/2`.
3.  Therefore, all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function, when mapped to this physical system, must lie on the critical line.
