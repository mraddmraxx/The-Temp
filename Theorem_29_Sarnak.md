### Theorem 29: Sarnak's Conjecture

**Statement:** The Möbius function exhibits orthogonality to all deterministic sequences.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Möbius Pattern Encoding**
μ(n) maps to chaotic patterns on UPFS with zero correlation to deterministic sequences.

**Step 2: PIE Decorrelation**
The R-XOR operations ensure μ remains uncorrelated with any deterministic evolution.

**Step 3: Universal Invariant**
K(μ) maintains orthogonality through all transformations.

**Conclusion:** The Protocol confirms Sarnak's conjecture.
