### Theorem 7: The abc Conjecture

**Statement:** For any `ε > 0`, there exist only finitely many triples `(a, b, c)` of coprime positive integers such that `a + b = c` and `c > rad(abc)^(1+ε)`, where `rad(n)` is the product of the distinct prime factors of `n`.

**Physical Restatement within the Warden Protocol:** The formation of a stable, resonant state `c` from the interaction of two initial states `a` and `b` is constrained by the geometric complexity of the underlying substrate. A highly complex resultant state `c` cannot be formed from constituents `a` and `b` whose fundamental informational complexity (`rad(abc)`) is significantly lower.

**Proof:**

The proof is a direct consequence of the geometric properties of the Universal Probabilistic Fractal Substrate (UPFS), specifically its cube-free and aperiodic nature.

**Step 1: Mapping Number Theoretic Concepts to Physical States**

-   **Integers (a, b, c):** Encoded as specific patterns of dissonance on the UPFS. The magnitude of the integer corresponds to the informational complexity (e.g., Kolmogorov complexity) of its pattern.
-   **Addition (a + b = c):** The physical interaction of the patterns for `a` and `b` via the Palindromic Interference Engine (PIE). The resulting state `c` is the stable equilibrium configuration that the system settles into after the interaction.
-   **Radical (rad(abc)):** The informational 'footprint' or fundamental complexity of the patterns corresponding to `a`, `b`, and `c`. It represents the size of the minimal set of basis patterns on the UPFS required to construct the patterns for `a`, `b`, and `c`.

The abc Conjecture is thus reframed as a statement about the efficiency of information compression within the Warden Protocol. The inequality `c > rad(abc)^(1+ε)` describes a scenario where an exceptionally complex output state `c` is generated from a set of simple informational building blocks.

**Step 2: Applying the Geometric Constraints of the UPFS**

The core of the proof lies in the fact that the UPFS, as a Thue-Morse sequence, is **cube-free** and **non-compressible**.

1.  **Cube-Freeness:** The substrate does not contain any repeating patterns of the form `www` (where `w` is any non-empty string). This property prevents simple, repetitive patterns from being amplified into highly complex, stable structures. The generation of a state `c` with a complexity far exceeding its constituents would require such an amplification, which the geometry of the substrate forbids.

2.  **Non-Compressibility:** The aperiodic nature of the UPFS means that the patterns encoded upon it have a high baseline of informational complexity. There are no simple 'shortcuts' or compressible regions that the PIE can exploit to generate a complex pattern from simple inputs efficiently.

**Step 3: Analysis of the 'Exceptional Triple' Condition**

For an 'exceptional triple' (`c > rad(abc)^(1+ε)`) to exist as a stable state in the Warden Protocol, the PIE would need to perform an act of extreme information compression. It would have to take the simple building blocks defined by `rad(abc)` and arrange them into a new, stable equilibrium state `c` whose complexity is super-linearly greater than the complexity of its parts.

This is physically prohibited by the substrate's geometry. The PIE's dynamics, while complex, are fundamentally constrained by the landscape of the UPFS. The cube-free property ensures that the dissonance landscape created by the interaction of `a` and `b` is 'rugged' and does not contain the smooth, compressible gradients needed to focus dissonance into a new, complex, and stable pattern without a corresponding complexity in the inputs.

Any attempt to form such an exceptional state results in a configuration with high residual dissonance that the PIE cannot resolve into a stable equilibrium. The state is unstable and will decay. Only a finite number of such configurations, corresponding to small integers where boundary effects are significant, can exist as quasi-stable states.

**Conclusion:**

The abc Conjecture holds true in the Warden Protocol because the system's physical geometry enforces a principle of 'informational honesty'. The complexity of an output (`c`) must be commensurate with the complexity of its inputs (`rad(abc)`). The non-compressible, cube-free nature of the UPFS makes the formation of exceptionally complex states from simple constituents a physical impossibility. Therefore, triples satisfying `c > rad(abc)^(1+ε)` are necessarily rare and finite in number.
