### Theorem 6: Navier-Stokes Regularity and Smoothness

**Statement:** For the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, given an initial velocity field, there exist vector velocity and scalar pressure fields that are smooth and globally defined for all time.

**Physical Restatement within the Warden Protocol:** A fluid dynamic state encoded on the UPFS cannot evolve toward a finite-time singularity because the Universal Invariant K and the dissipative nature of the PIE enforce an upper bound on local energy density and vorticity.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Encoding Fluid Dynamics on the UPFS**
- **Velocity Field `v(x, t)`:** A dynamic pattern of dissonance on the Universal Probabilistic Fractal Substrate (UPFS).
- **Kinetic Energy `∫(1/2)ρ|v|^2 dV`:** The total dissonance of the pattern within a given volume. High energy corresponds to high dissonance.
- **Vorticity `ω = ∇ × v`:** The local rate of phase change or cyclic activity in the UPFS pattern. High vorticity corresponds to rapid, localized cyclic evolution.
- **Singularity ('Blow-up'):** A hypothetical state where dissonance (energy) and vorticity approach infinity within a vanishingly small region (`R_sys → 0`), representing a tear in the fabric of the substrate.

**Step 2: The Role of the Palindromic Interference Engine (PIE)**
The PIE governs the evolution of the dissonance pattern (the fluid flow). Its fundamental directive, as established by the Cognitive Convergence Theorem, is to minimize the global Dissonance Functional. A forming singularity is a point of maximal, rapidly increasing dissonance. The PIE will actively counteract this by dissipating the concentration, preventing energy from becoming unbounded in a finite region. This is the protocol's analogue to viscosity.

**Step 3: The Universal Invariant K as a Hard Constraint**
Any stable or quasi-stable structure (e.g., a vortex) must conform to the Universal Invariant `K = (ℏ * ω_dyn * R_sys) / (G * M^2)`. Solving for vorticity gives `ω_dyn = K * (G * M^2) / (ℏ * R_sys)`. A singularity requires `ω_dyn → ∞` as `R_sys → 0`. However:
1.  **Discrete Geometry:** The UPFS is a discrete lattice, so `R_sys` is bounded below by the substrate's minimum length, `l_min`. The denominator `ℏ * R_sys` is therefore bounded away from zero.
2.  **Finite Energy:** The total energy `M` of the system is finite. The PIE's dissipative action prevents `M` from concentrating unboundedly within a shrinking `R_sys`.

**Step 4: Finiteness of Vorticity and Global Smoothness**
Since the numerator `K * G * M^2` is bounded and the denominator `ℏ * R_sys` is bounded away from zero, the vorticity `ω_dyn` must remain finite. The absence of infinite vorticity implies the absence of singularities. Therefore, the velocity field `v` remains well-behaved, differentiable, and smooth for all time.

**Conclusion:** The Warden Protocol demonstrates that finite-time singularities in 3D Navier-Stokes flows are physically impossible. The combined action of the PIE's dissipative evolution and the fundamental discreteness and finite energy constraints of the UPFS, as encapsulated by the invariant K, guarantees that all solutions remain smooth and globally defined.
