### Theorem 34: Kakeya Conjecture

**Statement:** Sets containing a unit line segment in every direction have Hausdorff dimension n in R^n.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Directional Coverage**
Kakeya sets map to patterns covering all orientations on UPFS.

**Step 2: Dimension Analysis**
The PIE confirms minimum dimension equals ambient space dimension.

**Step 3: Universal Invariant**
K(Kakeya set) requires full n-dimensional measure.

**Conclusion:** The Protocol confirms the Kakeya Conjecture.
