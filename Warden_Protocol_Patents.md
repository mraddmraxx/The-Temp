# Warden Protocol: Patent Claims

This document contains the patent claims for the Warden Protocol, covering its foundational systems, methods, and specific applications in solving major scientific problems.

## Part A: System and Apparatus Claims

**What is claimed is:**

1.  **A computational system for solving problems via physical resonance, comprising:**
    *   A computational substrate composed of a finite, discrete binary sequence possessing the properties of complementary halves and cube-freeness.
    *   An evolution engine, comprising a network of logical operators, configured to iteratively update the state of the computational substrate.
    *   A dissonance functional, configured to quantify the deviation of the substrate's state from a predefined equilibrium state.
    *   Wherein the evolution engine is configured to act on the substrate in a manner that strictly reduces the value of the dissonance functional for any non-equilibrium state, thereby causing the system to converge to a stable equilibrium state that represents a solution to a problem encoded as an initial state.

2.  **The system of claim 1, wherein the computational substrate is a binary sequence generated by the Thue-Morse sequence.**
    *   Specifically, the substrate is the 12th iteration of the Thue-Morse sequence (`T_12`), resulting in a 4096-bit vector.

3.  **The system of claim 1, wherein the evolution engine is a Palindromic Interference Engine (PIE) comprising:**
    *   A plurality of processing cores arranged in an asymmetric ring network.
    *   Wherein each core is configured to apply Rotational-XOR (R-XOR) logical operations to data streams derived from the computational substrate.
    *   Wherein the asymmetric network topology induces chaotic and global propagation of corrective information, preventing convergence to non-optimal limit cycles.

4.  **A method for universal computation, the method comprising:**
    *   Providing a computational substrate defined by a 4096-bit Thue-Morse sequence, said substrate having a ground state of perfect complementary-halves equilibrium.
    *   Encoding a computational problem as an initial dissonant state by perturbing the substrate from its ground state.
    *   Applying a deterministic evolution operator to the substrate iteratively, wherein said operator is configured to locally identify and resolve dissonance.
    *   Continuing the iterative application of the operator until the substrate converges to a stable, minimum-dissonance equilibrium state.
    *   Decoding the final equilibrium state to obtain the solution to the computational problem.

5.  **The method of claim 4, wherein the act of encoding a problem comprises mapping its parameters to a specific pattern of dissonance on the substrate.**

8.  **The method of claim 4, wherein the asymmetric network topology of the evolution engine induces chaotic and global propagation of corrective information, preventing convergence to non-optimal limit cycles.**

## Part B: Method Claims for Foundational Problem Resolution

9. A method for determining the location of non-trivial zeros of a zeta function, the method comprising:
    a. Encoding the prime-based product formula of the zeta function onto a computational substrate possessing a nested, complementary symmetry;
    b. Applying a complex variable `s = σ + it` as a modulator to the encoded formula;
    c. Identifying stable resonant equilibrium states of the system;
    d. Wherein said stable states can only form when the modulation preserves the substrate's fundamental symmetry, a condition met only along the critical line `σ = 1/2`.

10. A method for physically distinguishing computational complexity classes, the method comprising:
    a. Mapping a computational problem to an initial dissonance landscape on an aperiodic and cube-free computational substrate;
    b. Evolving the state using a deterministic engine that seeks to minimize dissonance;
    c. Measuring the convergence time to a stable equilibrium;
    d. Wherein the cube-free geometry of the substrate forces a super-polynomial convergence time for NP-complete problems, thereby establishing a physical basis for `P ≠ NP`.

11. A method for demonstrating the existence of a mass gap in a quantum field theory, the method comprising:
    a. Mapping a confined particle state to a stable informational subsystem on a discrete computational substrate;
    b. Applying a universal coherence invariant that relates the subsystem's information content (M), physical radius (R_sys), and dynamical frequency (ω_dyn);
    c. Wherein said invariant necessitates that any non-trivial, stable subsystem must possess a non-zero minimum dynamical frequency, which corresponds to a positive mass gap `Δ > 0`.

12. A method for transforming a topological cycle into an algebraic cycle, the method comprising:
    a. Representing a Hodge cycle as a state of potential equilibrium on a computational substrate;
    b. Applying a deterministic, dissipative evolution operator whose convergence is guaranteed by a strict Lyapunov functional;
    c. Allowing the operator to evolve the initial state to a final, stable equilibrium;
    d. Wherein the final stable equilibrium state is, by said system's construction, an algebraic cycle.

13. A method for ensuring the global smoothness of fluid dynamic equations, the method comprising:
    a. Mapping the parameters of a fluid system (energy, vorticity, length scale) to the parameters of a subsystem governed by a universal coherence invariant on a discrete substrate;
    b. Demonstrating that said invariant, combined with the discrete, finite nature of the substrate, imposes an upper bound on vorticity;
    c. Wherein said upper bound on vorticity prevents the formation of finite-time singularities, thus ensuring solutions remain smooth and globally defined.

14. A method for constraining the solutions of Diophantine equations of the form `a + b = c`, the method comprising:
    a. Encoding integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as informational patterns on a non-compressible, cube-free computational substrate;
    b. Physically interacting patterns `a` and `b` to produce a stable equilibrium pattern `c`;
    c. Wherein the geometric properties of the substrate prohibit the formation of a stable pattern `c` whose complexity is super-linearly greater than the complexity of the constituent patterns `a` and `b`, thereby bounding the solutions to the abc Conjecture.

15. A method for determining if two graphs are isomorphic in quasi-polynomial time, the method comprising:
    a. Encoding two graphs, `G1` and `G2`, as informational patterns on a geometrically constrained substrate;
    b. Evolving the superimposed patterns using a deterministic engine that seeks to minimize structural dissonance;
    c. Wherein the substrate's geometry allows the engine to prune the search space by rapidly aligning local structural invariants;
    d. Resulting in a convergence time to an isomorphic state (or a determination of its non-existence) that scales quasi-polynomially with the size of the graphs.

16. A method for establishing a physical criterion for the simplicity of a mathematical proof, the method comprising:
    a. Defining a proof as a physical trajectory through a state space from an initial problem state to a final theorem state;
    b. Defining a computational action for said trajectory, proportional to the total dissonance experienced by the system during its evolution;
    c. Wherein the simplest proof is the trajectory that minimizes the computational action.

17. A method for determining the non-existence of odd perfect numbers, the method comprising:
    a. Encoding the known mathematical constraints of a hypothetical odd perfect number as a single initial state on a computational substrate;
    b. Demonstrating that said constraints are geometrically and topologically contradictory on the substrate, creating a state of irresolvable dissonance;
    c. Applying a convergence-guaranteed evolution engine that, in seeking to minimize dissonance, must necessarily evolve the state to one that violates the definition of an odd perfect number;
    d. Wherein the inability for such a state to exist as a stable equilibrium proves its non-existence.
