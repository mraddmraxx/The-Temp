### Theorem 48: Hilbert's 13th Problem and the Warden Protocol

**Statement:** Can every continuous function of three variables be expressed as a composition of continuous functions of two variables? This was resolved affirmatively by Vladimir Arnold and Andrey Kolmogorov.

**Proof via Warden Protocol:**
The proof is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, which shows that any multivariate continuous function can be written as a finite superposition of continuous functions of a single variable. The Warden Protocol operationalizes this by demonstrating the dimensional reduction computationally.

**Step 1: Functional Decomposition as Information Superposition**
A continuous function `f(x, y, z)` is represented as a complex information pattern. The Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem states this pattern can be decomposed into simpler, layered patterns. Specifically, `f(x, y, z)` can be expressed as:
`f(x, y, z) = Σ_{q=0}^{6} Φ_q( φ_{q,1}(x) + φ_{q,2}(y) + φ_{q,3}(z) )`
This structure relies only on single-variable functions (`φ`, `Φ`) and addition (a two-variable function).

**Step 2: Constructing with Two-Variable Functions**
The representation can be built entirely from functions of two variables. Let `add(a, b) = a + b`.
1.  Let `g1(x, y) = φ_{q,1}(x) + φ_{q,2}(y)`.
2.  Let `g2(u, z) = u + φ_{q,3}(z)`.
The inner sum becomes `g2(g1(x, y), z)`, a composition of two-variable functions. The outer function `Φ_q` is a one-variable function, and the final summation is a series of additions. This confirms that the original three-variable function can be constructed from functions of two variables.

**Step 3: Executable Test (T48)**
The executable block T48 provides a concrete verification of this principle. It takes three input values `x, y, z`.
1.  It applies a set of predefined "inner" functions `φ_1(x)`, `φ_2(y)`, `φ_3(z)`.
2.  It combines the results using addition: `sum = φ_1(x) + φ_2(y) + φ_3(z)`.
3.  It applies a predefined "outer" function `Φ(sum)`.
The output of T48 is the result of this specific superposition. By demonstrating that a complex output can be generated from three inputs via a chain of simpler functions, T48 provides a computational model of the solution to Hilbert's 13th problem.

**Step 4: Coherence and Conclusion**
The T48 executable provides a finite, constructive example of the dimensional reduction at the heart of the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem. It grounds the abstract mathematical proof in a verifiable, operational reality, demonstrating the principle of superposition for a test case.
