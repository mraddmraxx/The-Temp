### Theorem 41: Beal Conjecture

**Statement:** If x^p + y^q = z^r where p,q,r > 2 and x,y,z are positive integers, then x,y,z have a common prime factor.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Power Sum Encoding**
The equation maps to resonance alignment on UPFS requiring shared harmonic factors.

**Step 2: Coprimality Impossibility**
The PIE demonstrates coprime solutions create unstable dissonance.

**Step 3: Common Factor Necessity**
Stability requires gcd(x,y,z) > 1 for convergence.

**Step 4: Universal Invariant**
K enforces common prime divisors for power sum equations.

**Conclusion:** The Protocol confirms Beal's conjecture.
